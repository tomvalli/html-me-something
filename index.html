                <p id="headerPgph">During this pandemic it has come to my attention that my bucket list partially consists of foods I have not eaten yet.  
                    There's certainly cool things I'd like to see and do but they seemed harder (and often too personal) to write about.

                        <p class="description"><span class="darkTxtBg">When I first heard of the sushi-rito (or <em>sushiritto</em>) it was something that I think was only available in the Pacific Northwest.  I believe
                            now you can get it in Saint Louis but I have yet to put in the effort to find it. When I read about this monstrosity I was
                            relatively new to eating sushi and was (and still am) VERY excited at the prospect of turning those delicious little morsels
                            of rice and fish and magic into a culinary affront to Jiro himself. Now that I think about it, a lot of the 'fusion' foods
                            I make for myself mostly involve shoving some sort of Americanized foreign dish into a tortilla.</span></p>

                        <p class="description">When I was younger I had an idea to combine two of the greatest foods on earth together into one unholy pie.  I am now certain 
                            was probably only the millionth person to think of this but at the time I regarded myself as some sort of junk food Einstein.
                            Think about it: You grab yourself a pizza shell, spread some sauce, plop on some &half; cooked pizza rolls, then cheese, then bake 
                            that bad boy.  Strangely, I've worked in enough pizza places and kitchens that I have had ample opportunity to make this by now. I 
                            think I am scared that it won't be as good as I imagine and don't want to ruin it for myself (After a disheartening experience with
                            Sloppy Joe pizza I'm not ready to spoil another dream quite so fast).

                        <p class="description">After moving to Maplewood, MO from South Saint Louis City in 2018 I had to find a Chinese place to replace Bo Fung for my occasional
                            General Tso's craving.  It turns out I live incredibly close to the Joy Luck Buffet.  Now, Chinese buffets (or any buffet really) 
                            can be extremely hit or miss but Joy Luck <strong>hits</strong>.  They even have ice cream!  We've only gone there a handful of times but the last time
                            we went a table near us ordered some sort of huge platter covered in thinly sliced meats with a little burner in the middle.  It looked
                            amazing.  I'm not even 100% sure that this was a Mongolian BBQ situation but it's the closest term I could find to describe it.

                        <p class="description">Yeah, I know, you can get this like anywhere.  For some reason when it comes time to order breakfast/brunch I just get all conservative. 
                            I mean, I've made hollandaise before as a line cook, I've just never eaten it on eggs.  Someday I will.

                        <p class="description">It's SO easy to find U.S.-Chinese food but I've never had "real" Chinese food.  I can't say there's a specific dish I've always wanted
                            to try but Chinese cuisine is super diverse and I think dim sum is the closest 'authentic' thing I can reasonably expect to find without
                            having to travel very far.

                            and pho is so iconic I feel like I really need to give it a try.

                        <p class="description">It's a boiled egg (soft-boiled I think) wrapped in sausage, breaded, and fried.  I like all those things.  It's something I could 
                            almost certainly make at home, but after completing this bucket list I will likely die of heart disease so this will probably be my last
                            meal. I should probably dine out for it ya know?
